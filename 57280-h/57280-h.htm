<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">THE FERN FLORA OF ILLINOIS.</span></h2>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By E. J. Hill.</span></p>
<p>The state of Illinois has an area of about 55,000
square miles. It lies between the parallels 37&deg; and
42&deg; 30&prime;, thus giving a length of 5&frac12;&deg; or about 380
miles. This north and south extension produces a
milder climate in the southern part, but no fern of essentially
southern distribution comes in except <i>Polypodium
polypodioides</i>, though the two quill-worts of
the state are perhaps better placed under this head
also. It is the lowest of the north-central states in
average altitude, the mean above sea level being about
600 feet, varying from 300 feet at the junction of the
Ohio and Mississippi rivers to 1250 feet at the Wisconsin
line in the extreme northwest part. As there
is nothing in these extremes of elevation to effect material
changes of temperature due to altitude, its
floristic features are not much modified in respect of
this. Anything of this character must be ascribed to
local conditions, not general causes. Another factor
that affects its floristic features is the dominance of
prairie within its boundary, the forests and woodlands,
sometimes very narrow strips, chiefly bordering its
streams and lakes. Since lands covered with grass are
not adapted to the growth of ferns, and consequently
are limited in species, their number and variety must be
much restricted for this reason. This must have been
the case in the primitive condition of the prairies before
they were so generally taken up for cultivation.
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
The loss in the original fern-flora is slight in this regard
when compared with that of flowering plants.
As nearly all of the state is in the region of the glacial
drift, the soil is influenced by this condition also. The
ravines cut in the drift and in the underlying rock
where it is reached, with their varying degrees of
moisture and shade, show the greatest variety in fern-life,
though a greater abundance of certain kinds may
be found in woods and swamps. The prevailing rocks
are limestone, but sandstones occur in some localities,
especially along the Illinois and Rock rivers. These
in some parts of the state, particularly in the coal
measures, the area of which is large, may be interstratified
with shales and slate. These rocks and the
soils resulting from their disintegration and decomposition,
taken in connection with those of the glacial drift,
provide a fair range of edaphic conditions for the
growth of ferns. It is evident that such as prefer a
calcareous soil will be best represented, if any preference
of this kind inheres in their nature.</p>
<p>It will be seen from the list that not quite one half
(56) of the Pteridophytes accorded specific rank in
&ldquo;Gray&rsquo;s New Manual of Botany&rdquo; (115) are reported
from this state. The genera are represented in larger
proportion, 23 of the 31 given, or if <i>Athyrium</i> be separated,
24 of 32, or three-fourths of them. All the species
of several of the smaller genera are found, up to
three in the case of <i>Osmunda</i>, but all of none with
species exceeding this number. The genus most fully
represented is <i>Equisetum</i>, eight of the ten, or nine of
eleven when <i>E. robustum</i> is given specific rank. To
these must be added <i>E. Ferrissii</i>, not in the Manual.</p>
<p>Reliable data for the distribution of the ferns of the
state are not very full. It is hoped that they may be
made more complete by the co-operation of those into
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
whose hands the list may fall. Many additions to the
number of species can hardly be expected. Doubtless
the state has been quite well explored in this respect.
I find only two to add to those published by Patterson
in 1876, <i>Isoetes Butleri</i>, described in 1878 from specimens
found in Indian Territory (Oklahoma) but
since found in this state, and <i>Equisetum Ferrissii</i>, a recent
addition. The list is mainly a compilation made
at the request of the editor of the <i>Fern Bulletin</i>. No
special fitness for the task is claimed, since my personal
knowledge of the region covered is almost wholly confined
to five of the northeastern counties, Kankakee,
Will, Cook, Dupage and Lake. Only casual trips of
slight duration have been made to other places. The
publication most relied on for the state at large is the
&ldquo;Catalogue of the Phaenogamous and vascular cryptogamous
plants of Illinois,&rdquo; H. N. Patterson, Oquauka,
Ill., 1876. His catalogue of plants growing in the immediate
vicinity of Oquauka has also been used. Friedrich
Brendel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flora Peoriana, Budapest, 1882,&rdquo; (the
German edition, but since given in English, I believe)
has furnished some definite information for a district
around the city of Peoria. The floras of H. H. Babcock
and of Higley and Raddin for Chicago and vicinity
have likewise been consulted, but as they respect
territory mainly familiar to the writer, could be cited
but little.</p>
<p>As explanatory of the plan followed I may state that
I have first mentioned the localities or stations with
which I am personally acquainted, and from which
examples are in my herbarium unless very common
throughout. Citations from Patterson&rsquo;s catalogue for
the state at large are entered in quotation marks followed
by (P.). Where Peoria is given the authority
is Brendel, where Oquauka, Patterson. A few have
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
been furnished by V. H. Chase, who collected in Stark

University, from data in the herbarium of the

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">A PROBLEMATICAL FERN.</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">(<i>Gymnogramma lanceolata.</i>)</span></h2>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By Willard N. Clute.</span></p>
<p>In the identification of fern species one occasionally
comes upon two forms so nearly alike that it requires
very careful study to decide whether they are two different
species or merely two forms of a single variable
species, but it is rare that one finds a fern that can as
well be placed in one genus as another, and still more
rare when the species possesses characters so like those
of ferns in other groups that it may be moved from
one tribe to another without violating any of the
botanical properties. The fern chosen for illustration
here is one of this latter character. It has been passed
back and forth between various genera in different
tribes, seldom resting long in one place, until it is a
very problematical species indeed.</p>
<p>In outline and manner of growth it possesses no especial
peculiarities. The lanceolate leaves might fit any
of a dozen or more species that might be mistaken for
it if the fruit dots or sori were absent. <i>Vittaria</i>, <i>Taemitis</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
<i>Antrophyum</i>, <i>Polypodium</i>, <i>Asplenium</i>, <i>Acrostichum</i>
and many other genera have species with leaf
outlines that almost exactly match it, but a glance at
the fruiting fronds, at once excludes many of these
genera as possible harbors for the species and at the
same time increases the difficulties of finally placing it.
The sori are apparently linear and <i>Scolopendrium</i> or
<i>Asplenium</i> comes to mind, but there is no indusium
and so the relationship is thrown into that group of
ferns clustering about such forms as <i>Gymnogramma</i>.</p>
<p>In fact, our fern was for a long time known as
<i>Gymnogramma lanceolata</i> and owing to this fact I
have selected this to stand as the name of the plant. A
glance at the illustration, however, will disclose a
frond not at all like the conventional <i>Gymnogramma</i>
frond, but it is as much like a <i>Gymnogramma</i> as it is
like the family to which the plant is now assigned.
Curious as it may seem this plant with elongated sori
oblique to the midrib is now regarded as a <i>Polypodium</i>!
Before its settling down in this genus, it
had been placed in <i>Antrophyum</i>, <i>Grammitis</i>, <i>Loxogramme</i>
and <i>Selliguea</i> as well as <i>Gymnogramma</i>.
This is by no means due to the variable nature of the
fern. Through all these vicissitudes it has remained
unchanged. The fluctuations from one genus to another
even from one tribe to a different one, have been
due to the varying opinions of mere man and his efforts
to fit the fern to a set of descriptions of his own
making. Circumstances such as these are quite sufficient
to justify the refusal to accept off-hand the
results of every &ldquo;revision&rdquo; which ambitious systematists
see fit to inflict upon us.</p>
<p>While reposing in the genus <i>Gymnogramma</i>, the
fern was well-known to be somewhat unorthodox. In
every large assemblage of species there are, in addition
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
to those which are typical, certain others that
diverge somewhat, but not enough to form a separate
genus. Thus our plant was placed in the section
<i>Selliguea</i>. Sometimes, indeed, <i>Selliguea</i> was isolated
as a separate genus, but usually accompanied by the
statement that if it were not for the shape of the sorus
it would make a good addition to the section <i>Phymatodes</i>
of <i>Polypodium</i>. Here, at least, is where it has
landed, the elongated sori being winked at, possibly,
or perhaps the species makers are willing to assume
each so-called sorus to be a series of <i>Polypodium</i> sori.
In this age, however, there are those who deny to the
species in the group <i>Phymatodes</i> the right to be included
in <i>Polypodium</i> and in certain books our species
appears as <i>Phymatodes loxogramma</i>. Just how this
<i>loxogramme</i> came to supplant <i>lanceolata</i> is another
story, not to be detailed here. Suffice to say that the
new name was picked up during one of the fern&rsquo;s
numerous transfers.</p>
<p>As to <i>Phymatodes</i>, it is likely that the species in this
group are distinct enough to form a genus by themselves
but it would be a rash student to encourage
such a departure, for once started we should soon see
all the large genera cut up into lesser groups and then
what delightful times the name-tinker would have!</p>
<p>By what ever name called, the species manages to
thrive over a wide stretch of country in the Eastern
Hemisphere, being found from Japan and China to
the Himalayas, Ceylon and the Guinea Coast and represented
in many of the islands of the Pacific including
Fiji and Samoa. The specimen from which the illustration
was made was collected by K. Miyake near
Kyoto, Japan where it is reported &ldquo;not so common.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">THE TALL SPLEENWORTS.</span></h2>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By Adella Prescott.</span></p>
<p>Some years ago when for me there were but two
species of ferns, those that were finely cut and those
that were not&mdash;and maidenhair&mdash;I supposed of course
that the narrow leaved spleenwort (<i>Asplenium angustifolium</i>)
was simply a hardy sword fern and that both
were varieties of the Christmas fern! But when I began
to read the fascinating pages of Clute and Parsons
and Waters I found, even in the early summer, that
there were differences and by the time the sori appeared
I was wise enough to recognize the characteristic
mark of the spleenworts. Even then I thought it but
a common fern for in the woods with which I was
most familiar it grew plentifully and it was not till
sometime later that I learned that it is at least rare
enough to insure for itself a welcome whenever found.</p>
<p>It is an extremely local plant and may be looked for
perhaps for years before being found though it has
a wide distribution and is apt to be plentiful where it
grows at all. It prefers rather moist soil and seems
to like Goldie&rsquo;s fern for a neighbor as I have often
found them in close proximity.</p>
<p>The fronds grow in tufts from a creeping rootstock
and are said to reach a height of four feet but all
that I have seen were shorter by at least a foot. The
blades are simply pinnate with many long, narrow
pinnules tapering to slender tips. The fertile fronds
are taller with the pinnules much narrower and the
linear sori borne in two rows along the midrib of each
pinnule. The fronds are delicate in texture and are
easily destroyed by summer storms, yet the plant is
able to adapt itself in some degree to its environment
for a plant that I have in a border where it is exposed
to cold winds has become much more rugged both in
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
appearance and in fact. It is a charming addition to
the fern garden making a pleasing foil to <i>Nephrodium
spinulosum</i>, <i>Dicksonia</i> and other finely cut varieties.</p>
<p>I think it is a pity that the silvery spleenwort has
no common name but one that is suggestive of a varied
assortment of &ldquo;blues,&rdquo; and that does not certainly belong
to it at that. But when we consider the discomforts
suggested by the word &ldquo;spleeny&rdquo; we may
think after all that this plain unassuming plant would
prefer to be classed among the spleenworts with their
fabled powers of healing rather than among the gentle
folk of the <i>Athyriums</i> where perhaps it rightly belongs.</p>
<p>The silvery spleenwort, <i>Asplenium thelypteroides</i>,
or <i>Athyrium thelypteroides</i> as some prefer to call it,
has few characteristics that would make it noticeable
among other species. It is of an ordinary size, from
two to three feet in height, and the fronds are produced
singly from a stout creeping rootstock but they
grow so close together as to suggest a circular crown.
They are once pinnate with deeply lobed pinnules and
have rather a soft velvety texture though quite thin
and delicate. The blade is oblong, tapering both ways
from the middle and there is little difference between
the fertile and sterile fronds.</p>
<p>The sori are borne in regular double rows on the
pinnules and while in general they are like those of the
spleenwort yet they are frequently curved after the
fashion of the lady fern, making a puzzling question
on which the botanical doctors fail to agree.</p>
<p>This species is fairly common over a wide area and
while not possessing any striking beauty is interesting
and attractive to the true lover of ferns.</p>

<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">FURTHER NOTES ON VARIATION IN BOTRYCHIUM RAMOSUM.</span></h2>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By Raynal Dodge.</span></p>
<p>On June 2nd of the present year I again visited the
Botrychium stations at Horse Hill, Kensington, N.
H., and at Newfound Hill in Hampton Falls. A description
of these was given in <i>The Fern Bulletin</i> April
1910. I found that a great change had taken place
since my last visit in 1907. The young trees had grown
wonderfully and shaded the station, the farm house
had been abandoned, the hens had disappeared, and
<i>Botrychium ramosum</i> had again taken its place at the
foot of the hill. But instead of the many thousands
which formerly grew there, I only succeeded in finding
about forty plants, some of them however, quite
robust and well grown. On the same day, in company
with a friend, I made a thorough search for <i>Botrychium
simplex</i> at Newfound Hill but failed to find a
single plant.</p>
<p>It appears that all the forms in the genus <i>Botrychium</i>
increase in numbers very slowly and that the
individual plants require many years to attain their
full development, but if the station for <i>Botrychium
ramosum</i> on Horse Hill escapes damage by fire or marauding
hens I think that within twenty years someone
perhaps now younger than I, may find a large colony
of <i>Botrychium simplex</i> at the old station on Newfound
Hill. Several of my young friends have undertaken
if possible to make a search.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of the readers of <i>The Fern Bulletin</i>
know of localities where <i>Botrychium ramosum</i> and
<i>B. simplex</i> are to be found growing near each other.
If any such are known it seems that further investigations
relating to this subject might be made. Or perhaps
it would be enlightening if spores of <i>B. ramosum</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
in sufficient quantity were to be sown on some dry
hillside that was easily accessible to the experimenter.
Immediate results however should not be expected as
these <i>Botrychiums</i> move very slowly, according to
some experimenters requiring several years before
germination of the spores. Moreover in the present
case the continued growth of the young plants would
be very much dependent on the amount of moisture
they might receive as is evidenced by the total destruction
of the plants at Newfound Hill by a very severe
drouth.</p>
<p>Since speaking on this subject before the members
of the American Fern Society I have been informed of
two other instances besides those at that time mentioned
where plants of <i>B. simplex</i> once found had disappeared
which seems further evidence that the form
<i>simplex</i> in <i>Botrychium</i> described by Hitchcock as
growing in dry hills is not self-perpetuating.</p>
<p><span class="lr"><i>Newburyport, Mass.</i></span></p>
<p>[To the instances of the disappearance of <i>B. simplex</i>,
may now be added the disappearance of the
colony found at Glen Park, Indiana in 1910. In that
year there was perhaps a hundred plants found. Every
year since, members of the Joliet Botanical Club and
others have searched for them but not a single specimen
has been discovered. Some <i>Botrychiums</i> have the
habit of resting for a year or more, but it hardly
seems likely that they would rest for three summers in
succession.&mdash;<i>Ed.</i>]</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">RARE FORMS OF FERNWORTS&mdash;XXII.</span></h2>
<h3 id="c14"><span class="sc">Still Another Christmas Fern.</span></h3>
<p>In 1893, the late James A. Graves found a curious
form of Christmas fern (<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>)
in the vicinity of Susquehanna, Pa., and removed it
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
to his garden where it continued to put forth its abnormal
fronds for many years and may still be alive
for anything the writer knows to the contrary. During
the period in which Mr. Graves gave his principal
attention to the study of ferns he was often advised to
describe his abnormal specimen, but he was always so
much engrossed in the study and cultivation of the
living ferns that he never found time to write a formal
scientific description of the plant, though he had
settled on a name for it. The form undoubtedly deserves
a distinctive name and since the discoverer is
no longer with us, it seems very fitting that the form
be named for him. I therefore offer the following description of</p>
<h3 id="c15"><span class="sc">Polystichum acrostichoides</span> f. <span class="sc">Gravesii</span>.</h3>
<p>Plant similar to the type but with the pinnae ending in
truncate tips from which the midveins project as
spinelike bristles. Type in the herbarium of Willard
N. Clute. Cotype in the herbarium of Alfred Twining,
Scranton, Pa.</p>
<p>Although the description is drawn from a single
plant it is likely that a search in the regions where the
Christmas fern is abundant would reveal other specimens
with the same peculiarity. Indeed, H. G. Rugg
in a paper before the Vermont Botanical Club, last
winter, described a plant that, to judge from his remarks
must be essentially the same thing. He says:
&ldquo;For several years I have had a peculiar form of this
fern growing in my garden. It is interesting because
of the truncate form of the pinnae and the multifid
form of the tip of the frond. The sterile fronds are
usually like those of the type plant. This fern I transplanted
into my garden several years ago and ever
since then it has continued to bear these peculiar
fronds. The late Mr. B. D. Gilbert was interested in
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
the plant and asked permission to describe it in the
<i>Fern Bulletin</i> but illness and finally death prevented.&rdquo;
Apparently the only difference between the Vermont
and Pennsylvania plants is the cristate apex, but as
forking tips are to be expected in any species this
feature is not extraordinary.</p>
<p>Mr. Graves usually spoke of his specimen as the
variety <i>truncatum</i>. This is the name it bears in some
herbaria and is the one it undoubtedly would have
borne in literature had he lived to describe it. Those
who were fortunate enough to have known Mr. Graves
personally, however, will be pleased to see his name
associated with one of the forms of that division of
the plant world which he studied so long and so assiduously.
It need hardly be said for the readers of
this magazine that Mr. Graves was one of the founders
of the Linnaean Fern Chapter the name by which
the American Fern Society was originally known, was
elected the first treasurer and held that office through
half the lifetime of the society, was one time president
of the same society and for a long time one of the most
resourceful of its Advisory Council members.</p>

<p>The drawing herewith was made from the middle

<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>

form and though without much beauty of outline is
still of interest for the form in which nature has cast
it.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">NOTES ON VARIOUS FERNS.</span></h2>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">By S. Fred Prince.</span></p>
<p>I was very much interested in Mr. Hill&rsquo;s article on
the cliff brakes in the January Bulletin. I lived at
Madison, Wisconsin, from 1874 to 1878, and have
gathered <i>Pellaea atropurpurea</i> many times from the
sandstone cliffs, not only on Lake Mendota, but also
Lake Monona and outcrops in other parts of the
&ldquo;Four-lake County.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found it growing on both the Potsdam and the
Madison sandstones. On the former it was only in
small clumps, or isolated plants, much more sparse in
growth than when on the latter, though I never found
it anywhere in such dense, tangled masses as it forms
in the clefts of the limestone rocks of the southwest
Ozarks.</p>
<p>I have also found <i>Pellaea atropurpurea</i> growing
thinly, on a dark red sandstone, at Paris Springs, Missouri,
not far from Springfield.</p>
<p>I would like to add to the localities of <i>Polypodium
vulgare</i> in Michigan. I found it, in the summer of
1910, growing in dense mats on sand dunes, south of
Macatawa, Michigan. The plants were in a woodland
composed principally of hemlock, with oak and a
general mixture of elm, maple, hickory, etc. When
you lifted a mat of the fern, the bare sand was left exposed.
I thought the conditions rather peculiar.</p>
<p>I found many ferns growing on these wooded sand
hills where, at the most, there was but half an inch of
soil on top of the white sand. The list includes:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p><i>Adiantum pedatum</i>; <i>Pteris aquilina</i>; <i>Asplenium
filix-foemina</i>, in marshy places between the dunes;
<i>Polystichum acrostichoides</i>, very sparingly; <i>Nephrodium
thelypteris</i>, very luxuriant, like the lady fern, in
marshy ground; <i>Nephrodium marginale</i>, the most
common fern; <i>Nephrodium cristatum</i>; <i>Nephrodium
spinulosum</i>, wherever there was a rotting chunk of
wood; <i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>, and <i>Onoclea struthiopteris</i>,
both very rank; <i>Osmunda regalis</i> and <i>Osmunda cinnamomea</i>,
these last four in marshy spots; and <i>Botrychium
virginianum</i>, on the sides of the dunes.</p>
<p>I have been observing the habits of <i>Onoclea sensibilis</i>
for many years, even raising plants from the
spores to five years old; caring for other plants for
years, changing conditions, and varying my experiments,
until I have come to the following conclusions:</p>
<p>When the soil is constantly and evenly moist and
unusually rich, and the plant is constantly shaded, it
tends to produce its fertile fronds flattened out like the
sterile, with all stages to those only partly rolled up.
These <i>unrolled</i> fertile fronds do not differ from the
<i>rolled up</i> ones, on the same plant, except in this one
particular.</p>
<p>When a heavy screen was changed so that the plants
would be in the full light and sun, the fertile fronds
produced the rest of the season were as tightly rolled
as usual, and it took two years of shading before these
plants produced open or unrolled fertile fronds again.
Varying the other conditions&mdash;moisture and nutriment,
had similar results, but less marked.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">SCHIZAEA PUSILLA AT HOME.</span></h2>
<p>Anyone who has seen this odd fern growing in its
native haunts will probably concur in the opinion held
by some, that while it is looked upon as one of the rarest
of ferns its small size and its habit of growing in the
midst of other low plants have no doubt caused it to be
passed over by collectors in many regions where it
really exists. This should be an encouragement to collectors
to keep the fern in mind in their field excursions
with a view to adding new stations for it to those now
known. The finding of a rare plant in a new locality
is always a source of especial pleasure to the discoverer,
aside from being an item of value to the botanist in
general.</p>
<p><i>Schizaea pusilla</i> was first collected early in this
century at Quaker Bridge, N. J. about thirty-five miles
east of Philadelphia. The spot is a desolate looking
place in the wildest of the &ldquo;pine barrens&rdquo; where a
branch of the Atsion river flows through marshy lowlands
and cedar swamps. Here amid sedge grasses,
mosses, <i>Lycopodiums</i>, <i>Droseras</i> and wild cranberry
vines the little treasure has been collected. But though
I have hunted for it more than once my eyes have never
been sharp enough to detect its fronds in this locality.</p>
<p>In October of last year, however, a good friend
guided me to another place in New Jersey where he
knew it to be growing and there we found it. It was
a small open spot in the pine barrens, low and damp.
In the white sand grew patches of low grasses, mosses,
<i>Lycopodium Carolinianum</i>, <i>L. inundatum</i> and <i>Pyxidanthera
barbata</i>, besides several small ericaceous plants
and some larger shrubs, such as scrub oaks, sumacs
etc. Close by was a little stream and just beyond that
a bog. Although we knew that <i>Schizaea</i> grew within
a few feet of the path in which we stood, it required the
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
closest kind of a search, with eyes at the level of our
knees before a specimen was detected. The sterile
fronds, curled like corkscrews, grew in little tufts and
were more readily visible than the fertile spikes which
were less numerous and together with the slender stipes
were of a brown color hardly distinguishable from the
capsules of the mosses and the maturing stems of the
grasses which grew all about. Lying flat upon the
earth with face within a few inches of the ground was
found the most satisfactory plan of search. Down
there all the individual plants looked bigger and a sidelong
glance brought the fertile clusters more prominently
into view. When the sight got accustomed to
the miniature jungle, quite a number of specimens were
found but the fern could hardly be said to be plentiful
and all that we gathered were within a radius of a
couple of yards.</p>
<p>This seems, indeed to be one of the plants whose
whereabouts are oftenest revealed by what we are wont
to term a &ldquo;happy accident&rdquo; as for instance, when we
are lying stretched on the ground, resting, or as we
stoop, at lunch, to crack an egg on the toe of our shoe.
I know of one excellent collector who spent a whole day
looking for it diligently in what he thought to be a
likely spot but without success when finally, just before
the time for return came, as he was half crouching
on the ground, scarcely thinking now of <i>Schizaea</i>,
its fronds suddenly flashed upon his sight, right at his
feet.</p>
<p>The sterile fronds of <i>Schizaea pusilla</i> are evergreen
so the collector may perhaps best detect it in winter selecting
days for his search when the ground is pretty
clear of snow. The surrounding vegetation being at
that time dead the little corkscrew-like fronds stand
out more prominently. The fertile fronds die before
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
winter sets in but their brown stalks frequently nevertheless
remain standing long after.&mdash;<i>C. F. Saunders in
Linnaean Fern Bulletin, Vol. 4.</i></p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">PTERIDOGRAPHIA.</span></h2>
<p><span class="sc">A New Fern Pest.</span>&mdash;According to the <i>British
Fern Gazette</i> a new pest threatens the specimens of
those who collect living plants. This is the larva of
a small weevil which gets into the stipes of the ferns
and burrowing downward into the heart of the rhizomes
soon cause the death of the plant. The weevil
is of Australian origin, probably introduced into Britain
with imported plants. Its scientific cognomen is
<i>Syagrius intrudens</i>. At first its depredations were
confined to ferns under glass, but more recently it has
taken to the ferns in the wild state. This, however,
is not the only enemy of the ferns that British growers
have to contend with. Another small beetle
known as the vine weevil (<i>Otiorhyncus sulcatus</i>) is
fond of the plants both in the adult and larval stages,
but the newcomer has already developed a reputation
for destructiveness that places it first as a fern pest.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Walking Fern and Lime.</span>&mdash;Nearly everybody
who cultivates the walking fern (<i>Camptosorus rhizophyllus</i>),
thinks it necessary to supply it with a
quantity of old mortar, quick-lime or pieces of limestone
under the impression that the fern cannot live,
or at least cannot thrive without a considerable
amount of calcium in the soil. As a matter of fact it
has been reported on sandstone, shale, gneiss and
granite and may possibly grow on others. Its noticed
preference for limestone is apparently not due to its
dependence on calcium but rather to the fact that it is
more nearly adjusted to the plant covering of limestone
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
rocks than it is to others. It will grow in any
good garden soil, but in such situations it must be
protected from its enemies, the ordinary weeds of cultivation,
which otherwise would soon run it out. The
same thing is true of many plants besides ferns. The
cactus plant that cheerfully endures the intense insolation
and frequent drouth of the sand barrens, succumbs
very soon to the grass and weeds when planted
in rich soil.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Stipe or Stipes.</span>&mdash;When it comes to the designation
of the stalk of a fern leaf, there is a wide difference
in the way British and Americans regard it.
Americans invariably speak of a single stalk as a stipe
and they may be somewhat astonished, upon referring
to a dictionary, to find that while stipe is given as a
legitimate word, it comes direct from the latin <i>Stipes</i>
which the Britons, with perhaps a more classical education,
are accustomed to use. In America the plural
of stipes is stipes or, rather, the plural of stipe is
stipes; but in England the plural of both stipe and
stipes is <i>stipites</i>. In certain uncultivated parts of our
own country the singular form of the word species is
given as specie; but when we smile at some countryman&rsquo;s
description of a specie of fern, our merriment
may be somewhat tempered by the thought that we
still say stipe instead of stipes. If we could only
believe that we use stipe with full knowledge of its
derivation, it would not seem so bad, but it is very
evidently a case of plain ignorance.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Apogamy in Pellaea.</span>&mdash;Apogamy, or the production
of a new sporophyte from the gametophyte without
the union of egg and sperm, used to be considered
a rather rare phenomenon, but as more study is given
the matter, it begins to seem fairly common. Several
years ago Woronin reported apogamy in <i>Pellaea flavens</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
<i>P. niveus</i> and <i>P. tenera</i> and still more recently
W. N. Steil of the University of Wisconsin reported
the same condition in our native <i>Pellaea atropurpurea</i>.
In Steil&rsquo;s specimens the young sporophytes were borne
on the prothallus lobes near the notch. The same investigator
is now working on apogamy in other species.
A note in a recent number of this magazine asked for
spores of <i>Pellaea gracilis</i> (<i>Cryptogramma Stelleri</i>) for
this purpose.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Lycopodium lucidulum porophylum.</span>&mdash;In the
<i>Ohio Naturalist</i> for April Prof. J. H. Schaffner devotes
several pages to a discussion of the specific distinctness
of forms allied to <i>Lycopodium lucidulum</i>
and comes to the conclusion that <i>Lycopodium porophylum</i>
is a good species. If one is to judge by appearances
alone, there can be no question as to <i>L.
lucidulum</i> being different from <i>L. porophylum</i> but if
the different appearances that plants put on under different
conditions of warmth, light and moisture are to
be considered then there are a number of fern species in
this country in need of a name. Compare <i>Woodsia obtusa</i>
grown on a sunny cliff with the same species
grown on a moist one, or <i>Equisetum arvense</i> in woods
and on railway banks. Nobody at present can say positively
whether the form called <i>porophyllum</i> is a species
or not. If it can be grown in moisture and shade while
still retaining its characters, or if its spores will produce
plants like the parent when sown in moist
shades, then the case should be considered closed.
Meanwhile, if one were to imagine a dry ground form
of <i>L. lucidulum</i> what kind of a plant would he construct?
Perhaps prostrate stem shorter; branches in
a denser tuft, shorter; leaves less notched, smaller;
whole plant yellower. Well, that is the description of
<i>L. porophylum</i>!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Affinities of Taenitis.</span>&mdash;The genus <i>Taenitis</i> is
one that has always puzzled botanists. It was once
placed in the tribe Grammitideae along with such
genera as <i>Notholaena</i>, <i>Brainera</i>, <i>Meniscum</i>, <i>Vittaria</i>,
<i>Hemionitis</i> and <i>Drymoglossum</i>, and it has also been
considered sufficiently distinct to stand as the type of
a tribe named for it, while recently it has been considered
as a member of the tribe <i>Polypodicae</i>. Now
comes E. B. Copeland in the <i>Philippine Journal of
Science</i> and gives the genus another turn and this
time places it in the Davallieae largely upon the relationship
shown by the internal structure of the stem
and the character of the scaly covering. It is likely
that the new manipulator of the genus is as near right
as anybody. The main thing is to discover what are
the real indications of relationships. With some students
it is venation, with others the shape and position
of the indusium, with others the character of the
vestiture and still others may have other rules by
which to judge. When we agree upon the proper earmarks,
anybody ought to be able to put the ferns in
their proper groups.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Sporophyll Zones.</span>&mdash;The fact is well known that
some of the club-mosses, notably the shining club moss
(<i>Lycopodium lucidulum</i>) and the fir club-moss (<i>L. Selago</i>),
bear their sporangia in bands or zones that
alternate with regions on the stem in which there are
no sporophylls, but it does not seem to be equally well
recognized that the same phenomena are found pretty
generally among the ferns. If one will examine the
crowns of the cinnamon fern, it will be readily seen that
sporophylls and vegetative leaves form alternating circles.
Curiously enough, the fertile fronds, which appear
at maturity within the circle of sterile leaves, really
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
belong to the outer circle, as befits the group that
is to develop first. The sensitive and ostrich ferns are
other species in which the zones of fronds are very distinct.
So pronounced is this, and so far has each kind
developed before unfolding, that each is usually incapable
of taking up the functions of the other in cases
where the destruction of one kind makes such exchange
necessary or desirable. From efforts on the part of the
plant to supply vegetative tissue to leaves designed
originally for spore-bearing, only, we owe the various
&ldquo;obtusilobata&rdquo; forms occasionally reported. The differences
in zonation here mentioned are most pronounced
in ferns with dimorphic fronds, but evidences
of the same thing, more or less distinct may be found
even in those ferns that have the fertile and sterile
fronds essentially alike in outline. As a usual thing,
the spore-bearing leaves are produced after the vegetative
leaves have unfolded and when we find a plant in
full fruit in late summer, that lacked spores in spring,
it is due to the developing of the fertile leaves later.
This is especially true and most noticeable in ferns that
produce their fronds in crowns, but even in those
species with running rootstocks, we commonly find
evidences of zonation. Following out the idea of zonation
we find among many of the fern allies that not only
are the sporophylls assembled in zones but the zones
terminate the central axis or branch. Under such circumstances
the shoot begins to take on many of the
characteristics of the flower and if we allow the definition
of a flower as a shoot beset with sporophylls, it
really is a flower. In the plants in which the flower
comes to its highest development this structure is essentially
a group of two kinds of sporophylls set
round with sterile leaves called petals and sepals. Did
ferns, instead of selaginellas, produce two kinds of
sporophylls, the whole fern plant with its crown of
fronds, would be very like a flower.</p>

<p>The last number of this magazine&mdash;that for October
1912&mdash;will be a comprehensive index of the publication
for the past ten years. This, with the index to the
first ten volumes, will form an exceedingly valuable
index to the fern literature of America, covering, as
it does, the whole period of popular fern study. It
begins some years before the appearance of any popular
fern book and has either published entire all important
articles issued since or given a summary of
them. Mr. S. Fred Prince, long a member of the
Fern Society is already at work on the index and we
hope to issue it not later than the end of the year.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Further information received from the purchaser of
the complete set of this magazine recently sent to
Germany, apprises us of the fact that the set is not
to remain in Europe. It was purchased for a customer
in South America (Argentine), therefore the
set owned by M. C. Belhatte at Paris is the only one in
Europe. The recent set is also the only complete set
in South America, and there are not, so far as we are
aware, complete sets in other parts of the Old World
though the set at the Tokyo Botanical Garden ought
to be nearly complete and the set owned by D. Leroy
Topping at Manila lacks only two numbers.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>Next year it will be too late to get odd numbers to
complete files that lack them. When this magazine
goes out of business we shall retain only complete
volumes. This is the time for all who need odd numbers
to ask for them. We have recently advertised
to send any back volume later than volume 9 for 50
cents and this offer will hold good until the end of the
year. After that time, single volumes cannot be had
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
unless we happen to have a surplus. We are willing
to replace soiled, torn or missing numbers free if requested
to do so at once, and the fact that odd volumes
will soon be unobtainable should incline all whose
sets are incomplete to add the missing volumes while
they can.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">BOOK NOTES.</span></h2>
<p>In anticipation of the consolidation of this magazine
with <i>The American Botanist</i> at the end of the
year, some very extensive improvements in the new
magazine are to be made. Among the more important
are a better grade of paper, the use of numerous
illustrations, and the addition of enough pages to make
it the largest magazine for the price in America. With
the beginning of 1913 a department of ornamental
gardening will be included in which the cultivation of
our showy wild-flowers will receive adequate treatment.
This magazine will continue the matter relative
to ferns now appearing in <i>The Fern Bulletin</i> and
all manuscripts used will be paid for. No reader of
Fern Bulletin should fail to subscribe for the new
<i>American Botanist</i> if they wish to keep abreast of the
times in botany. Those who subscribe for 1913 before
November 20th, will receive the November issue
free.</p>
<p class="tb">Messrs. Ginn &amp; Co. have nearly ready for publication
a book on Agronomy by the editor of <i>The Fern
Bulletin</i> which should be of interest to all who have
anything to do with cultivating plants. Although the
book is intended as a school book to be used in connection
with gardening courses, the fact that it not
only gives directions for planting and cultivating
kitchen vegetables and flowering plants, but explains
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
the principles upon which such directions hinge, will
make it of much value to the gardener whether amateur
or professional. The book, however, is not a
mere gardening manual. It discusses soils and their
origin, the fundamentals of landscape work and plant
breeding, and the effects of heat, light and moisture
upon plants in general. There will also be more than
200 illustrations.</p>
<p class="tb"><span class="sc">Ferns Weighing a Ton.</span>&mdash;In the tropics ferns often
attain the height of small trees, but their trunks are usually
so slender that they never are of any great weight.
For the heaviest trunks we must look among lowlier
species, where the circumference of the short trunk in
some cases is so great that immense weights are attained.
In Australia and New Zealand there grows a
relative of the common cinnamon fern named <i>Todaea
barbata</i> which quite takes the palm in this respect. The
trunks are great rounded mosses five or six feet high
and at least twenty feet in circumference, most of the
upper surface being beset with living fronds. Specimens
have been found with trunks that were estimated
to weigh more than a ton and a half.</p>

distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
